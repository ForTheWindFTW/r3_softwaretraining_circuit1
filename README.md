# r3_softwaretraining_circuit1

## Process
Starting off, many parts of this training package were confusing, but after working through these main steps, I became much more comfortable working with circuits and TinkerCAD.

- Created a [smaller circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9jNt476gUKP) (3x flashing LEDs)

  - Watched [videos](https://youtu.be/8gvJzrjwjds) on basic electricity and LED connections
  - Used Arduino's [Language Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)
- Tested and learned more about the Hobby Gearmotors and DIP switches
- Completed [Circuit1 design](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5R3EwdZ4ZUq)

  - Once again used Arduino's [Language Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)
  - Used other materials to confirm my interpretation to the solution was correct
- Learned about [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), reviewed [Git](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-to-Git-ac396a0697704709a12b6a0e545db049) and pushing to [GitHub](https://github.com/ForTheWindFTW/r3_softwaretraining_circuit1).

## Reflection
Learning about [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and circuits incrementally made this project much easier to work on, as I was able to gain bits of knowledge and piece them together. I also noticed that the coding felt extremely familiar, since I had previous experience with [RobotC](http://www.robotc.net/) in my highschool's Robotics Team. This exercise was great in allowing me to review and train my skills, and I am looking forward to everything else that R3 is involved in!
